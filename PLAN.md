**Personal Responsibilities:**

* Dylan Peters (dlp22): Primarily responsible for creating cells that behave correctly in both the rectangular and hexagonal coordinates. Creating a set of default cells and terrains that the user can select from. Creating cell abilities. Also organizing meetings and overall sprint logistics.

* Kris Elbert (ke60): Grid navigation, possible position selections

* Faith Rodriguez (far10): Work on development tool and editing panes, customization, and placement

* Stone Mathers (smm117) - Menu bar, creating new sprites, 

* Tavo Loaiza (eol) 

* Alexander Zapata (az73) - Primarily responsible for the GameEngine API and its subsequent implementations that  will serve as the game manager that will determine the turn orders, the ways in which winning conditions and turn actions will be handled. Also responsible for the GameState API. In very basic terms, I will be  
working on the the external API for the project along with Noah.

* Noah Pritt (ncp14): Implementation of controller to pass information between front-end and back-end. Create Model class. Receive Groovy code from the front-end and parse/translate it appropriately. In extension stage, will be in charge of multiplayer gameplay based on Firebase, if time permits.

* Timmy Huang (th174)

* Sam Schwaller (scs51): selection screen(save vs dev), save and load for play and development, instructions 

* Andreas Santos (ajs118): Backend implementation of Grid Package Classes. Flexible/will do more as needed.

**Team Responsibilities:**

* Front End: Create a streamlined user interface that allows easy population of fields in order to create games quickly and easily. Communicate with the back end to determine how the front end will update when back end changes are made, and how the front end will manipulate the back end.

* Back End: Create a well-designed Model that allows the user to create many different, flexible game types. Communicate with the front end to determine how the front end will update when back end changes are made, and how the front end will manipulate the back end.

**Communication Expectations:** The team has a GroupMe with every team member that will be used for team-wide communication -- organizing team meetings, considering design changes, etc. The front end and back end teams will make group messages for team-specific communication. Finally, when we break up into individual teams to work on features, team members will communicate directly. Partners should be made aware when major changes have been made in the Gitlab repository or to the design. Understandably, every team member will have weeks when they have significant amounts of work in other classes. On such a week, they should communicate with their partners to let them know that they may not have as much time to commit to work, in order to prevent resentment due to lower work output.

**Work expectations:** Each team member will begin working at the beginning of each sprint, and will work throughout the week to create his or her features. He or she will notify the partners with which he or she has been working most closely in order to tell them when significant changes to the design have been made.


**Gitlab Expectations:** We will use a feature-based branching workflow on Gitlab. When a new feature is being created, the team members will commit and push to their branch. Once the feature is functional, it can be merged to master, and the branch deleted in order to keep the Gitlab repository clean.
