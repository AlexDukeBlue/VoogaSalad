**Team Procedures**

1. Day, time, and place for regular team meetings: 

We will hold meetings within the front and back end teams as needed.  Team members will be communicative regarding their availability. The location will vary, but the supportive emotional environment will remain the same.

2. Preferred method of communication (e.g., e-mail, cell phone, wired phone, Blackboard Discussion Board, face-to-face, in a certain class) in order to inform each other of team meetings, announcement, updates, reminders, problems: 

We will rely on GroupMe to communicate with each other.

3. Decision-making policy:

Decisions will be made by a discussion, including opening arguments and expert witnesses, followed by a majority vote. For example, it was decided by a majority vote that front braces should not get their own new line, where they are as isolated and alone as Noah on a Friday night. Team members who continue in this abominable habit will be reprimanded. See **Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations **for further details.

4. Method for setting and following meeting agendas (Who will set each agenda? When? How will team members be notified/reminded? Who will be responsible for the team following the agenda during a team meeting? What will be done to keep the team on track during a meeting?): 

The meeting agendas will be set and followed by the current Overlord in charge.  (Overall - Dylan, Back End - Timmy, Front End - Stone). Self-appointed Mage of Game-Eenginry: Noah. Overlords must hold their teams accountable and update everyone on their current timeline. The Mage is expected to hold himself to an even higher standard, a god-like standard.

**Team Expectations Work Quality **

1. Project standards (What is a realistic level of quality for team presentations, collaborative writing, individual research, preparation of drafts, peer reviews, etc.?):

We expect that we will achieve our basic goals and use checkpoints to determine a reasonable schedule. Quality is incredibly important, and through establishing a good inter-team relationships ;) we will achieve an environment of easy communication and natural collaboration. Merge requests will be reviewed by another team member in order to ensure quality and adherence to team standards. Team members are expected to research appropriate information in order to accomplish their tasks ;). All documentation will be reviewed by team members so that there is agreement.

2. Strategies to fulfill these standards: 

We believe that establishing a bond through cultish chanting, we will desire to work for the benefit of the team and support each other. Through constant review and a familial, satanic atmosphere, we will ensure accountability, consistent standards, and suitable quality. Trust and communication, according to an example Guidelines for Writing Team Contract document as supplied through the CompSci 308 Spring 2017 website, are important and must be fostered and cultured. By indoctrinating each other and sharing the community environment of a coven, we are setting ourselves up for success, in this world and the next.

**Team Participation** 

1. Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks: 

As specific features within the project are prioritized, each team subsection will meet to agree upon their members’ responsibilities at that time.  By making this a team discussion, we will ensure that everyone is comfortable with everyone’s tasks, including their own.

2. Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members (team maintenance): 

We believe that holding most of our teams within front and back end will ensure that each person feels comfortable including their ideas. Through the use of bonding and awkward silences, we expect that everyone will feel comfortable and have the opportunity to share their ideas.

3. Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance): 

In order to keep on task, we will send multiple deadlines within each sprint to ensure that all of the work for this project is not done the day before a sprint ends.

4. Preferences for leadership (informal, formal, individual, shared): 

An Oligarchy of Overlords have been elected. They will assume the leadership role for the portion of the project within their title (Dylan - Overall Logistics; Timmy - Back End Design; Stone - Front End Design) and will communicate with one another.

**Personal Accountability **

1. Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings: 

Members must make a best effort to attend and arrive on time to all meetings scheduled by the overlords. If you can’t make a meeting or will be late, let the rest of the team members know.

2. Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines: 

Team members will be expected to be accountable for following team deadlines and will communicate as early as possible if they need help or more time.

3. Expected level of communication with other team members: 

1. Tell people **before** you make major design changes

2. Declare what you expect other people’s code to do, but don’t change it yourself. Make sure your requirements are clear, and assist others in meeting those requirements if necessary.

3. Notify the GroupMe if one submits a merge request so people can pull sooner rather than later, as then they will suffer through resolving merge conflicts.

4. Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks.

1. Members are responsible for fulfilling their assigned tasks and asking for help or notifying others if their timeline must be adjusted.

2. If there are any discrepancies or uncertainties regarding deadlines or assignments or team decisions, members are expected to discuss this rather than passively aggressively rolling their eyes and building a quiet resentment towards the team as a whole.

3. If a team member says they can do something, they are expected to do it. If they are asked to do something, they can negotiate but are expected to attend meetings, keep up with the schedule, and keep in touch with other team members to deliver high quality, well-designed, Duvall-pleasing code.

4. Team members must dedicate their lives to this project and tie their self-esteem to the end result.

 

**Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations**

1. Describe, as a group, you would handle infractions of any of the obligations of this team contract: 

[Serious Consequences]:

1. The team members with which they are working most closely will contact them individually and ask why they have been unable to fulfill the expectations.

2. If the behavior does not change in a timely manner, the team members will refer the matter to the Overlords, who will discuss the expectations with the team member found lacking. The Overlords will try to work with the member to figure out how he/she can improve, or if the member needs to be switched to a different part of the project.

3. If the above steps do not work, the Overlords and the team member who reported the poor behavior will contact Duvall and work out a solution.

[Other Possible, Less Serious Consequences]:

1. They will be shamed. All respect will be revoked until reparations are made (food).

2. They will be roasted past medium rare in the GroupMe. Their posts will not be liked.

3. Once they have discussed their issues with the team or Overlords, they **may** be forgiven.

2. Describe what your team will do if the infractions continue:

1. They will be warned.

2. They will be messaged on GroupMe, texted, called, messaged on Facebook, unfollowed on Instagram, and DMed on Twitter to make sure they have received their warning and take it seriously. Everyone on the team will poke them on Facebook and tag them in terrible memes.

3. They will buy the entire team dinner on food points during the next meeting.

4. If they remain unresponsive, Duvall will be contacted.
