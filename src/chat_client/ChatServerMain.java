/**
 * This class models a simple chat server. It allows clients to connect to the local host and facilitate communication between the client users.
 * <p>
 * An ObservableServer listens for requests from each client in a background thread, and relays them to the other clients if approved.
 * <p>
 * The server sends heartbeat requests periodically to each client, and either confirms that they are functioning properly or attempts to repair errors if they are not.
 * <p>
 * New clients are provided with a full log of all previous messages sent since the server began running.
 * <p>
 * If a client fails to respond within the timeout duration, the connection is terminated.
